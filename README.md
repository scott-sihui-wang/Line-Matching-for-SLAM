This project corresponds to the paper `Multiple Homography Estimation via Stereo Line Matching for Textureless Indoor Scenes` that I published on `International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics` (ICCAR 2019). This paper can be found online at: [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=iccar&tdsourcetag=s_pctim_aiomsg).
