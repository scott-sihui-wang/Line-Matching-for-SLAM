# Line Matching for SLAM

This project corresponds to the paper `Multiple Homography Estimation via Stereo Line Matching for Textureless Indoor Scenes` that I published on `International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics` (ICCAR 2019). This paper can be found online at [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8813439).
